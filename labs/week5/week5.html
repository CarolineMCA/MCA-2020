	<h2> Task 1</h2>

		<h3>Creating 1000-song database - metadata </h3>
	
		<p>	The metadata schema listed below represents the information I believe would be important in describing a music database with 1000 songs. 
		Such variety of metadata would be able to describe many different pieces of music. 
		This information would not only provide data about the original file such as artist name, album title, song title,
		but would also provide inforamtion about: encoding and transcription of the files, any changes that have been made, a larger piece of work that 
		the file is part of, and would, e.g. allow to track the progress of and subsequent work on the file, by providing version information.  		
		
		<p>'After the Gold Rush' metadata file can be accessed <a href="After_the_Gold_Rush_week5.mei">here.</a>
