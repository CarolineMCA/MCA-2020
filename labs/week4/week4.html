	<h1> Week 4: Computational analytics of notated music </h1> 
	
	<h2> Task 1</h2>

		<h3>jSymbolic MIDI analysis </h3>
		
		<p>The jSymbolic .csv file I generated for 'After the Gold Rush' can be downloaded <a href="afterthegoldrush-jsymbolic.csv">here.</a></p>
	
		<p>
		jSymbolic analysis of the transcribed piece can by found below. In selecting additional features for the analysis I chose the ones I believe can be relevant and interesting for this song (e.g variation of dynamics as in the piece it changes few times, or 
		voice equality-range, as there were very high and very low notes, and this values shows the standard deviation of differences between these notes).

		<h3>music21 analysis and visualisation </h3>
		
				
		<p>
		Below there are three analytical visualisations of 'After the Gold Rush' made with music21 software. 
		
		<br>
		<figure style="text-align:center">
		<img src="note-quarter-length-by-pitch-part-1.png" alt="note-quarter-length-by-pitch-part-1-plot" width="700">
		<figcaption>
		Piano roll of pitches illustrates how each pitch changed through the song. It takes into account the length of the notes and their order. <!--There seems to be a correlation of the distribution of notes 
		across the whole piece with features represented with other analytical tools of music21 software.-->

		<img src="scatter-plot-of-pitches.png" alt="scatter-plot-of-pitches" height="700">
		<figcaption>
		Scatter plot of pites correlates pitch againt the length of the notes. <!--, and the visualised distribution correspons with other representations made with music21 for this piece, e.g. piano roll of pitches above.-->

		<figure style="text-align:center">
		<img src="pitch-histogram.png" alt="pitch-histogram" height="700">
		<figcaption>
		Pitch histogram shows how many times each note was played in this song.
		Analysis of this visual representation indicates that most common pitch was D4. This value corresponds with jSymbolic output presented above. <!-- When compared to the jSymbolic output of mean pitch (around 61), it is clear that the data
		is consistent across these two analytical tools. The value of 61 represents MIDI number (a numerical representation of pitch) and corresponds to the most played pitch, according to hostogram output, that is note D4.
