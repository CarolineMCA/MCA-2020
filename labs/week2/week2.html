	<h1> Week 2: Transcribing notated music </h1> 
	
	<h2> Task 1</h2>

		<h3>Transcribed piece of music </h3>
	
		<p>For this week's lab activity I decided to transcribe one of the most known song by Neil Young, 'After the Gold Rush'. 
		I accessed the music score from the site Sheet Music Download. It is a free music sheet resource. It provided notes for this song for piano and vocal,
		and my transcription follows this. The original file can be accessed as a PDF file <a href="https://www.sheetmusicdownload.in/piano/sheets/2149/Neil_Young_After_The_Gold_Rush.html"> here.</a>
		I transcribe the piece using the software MuseScore.	
		
		<p>The transcribed MuseScore file is presented below. It can be downloaded <a href="After_the_Gold_Rush.mscz">here.</a></p>
