	<h1> Week 10: Similarity and Transcription</h1> 
	
	<h2> Task 1</h2>

		<h3>Similarity Matrix and Genre Comparison</h3>

				Similarity Matrix
				</figcaption>
			  </div>
			  <div class="column1">
			  <p>In similarity matrix: Tracks 0-3 represent classical genre. Tracks 4-6 are classified as rock. Track 7 ('Baltimore Raven') represents blues. Track 8 is jazz ('Caravan'). Track 9 represents classical genre ('Variatio 2 a 1 Clav.'). 
			  Last three tracks are the same I was using in previous labs. They also represent genres closely related to the music I analysed in this portfolio. 
			Analysis of similarity matrix supports the classification of the last three tracks (7-9). 
			  It is clear that tracks 7-8 are similar to tracks 4-6 (rock). Rock is highly influenced by jazz and blues, and rock music has roots in blues. Hence, there is a higher similarity between tracks 4-8, than between those tracks and the rest. 
			  Track 9, a classical piece, is similar to track 0-3, of the same genre. It is also distinct from the other two of my tacks (7 and 8). </p>

		<h2> Task 2</h2>

		<h3>Transcription from Midi/MuseScore to Audio/Wav and back to Midi/MuseScore </h3>
		
		<p>I have used the track I transcribed during week 2 - After the Gold Rush by Neil Young.
		On the left there is a Midi/MuseScore representation of a file transcribed from audio back to Midi. On the right is the originally notated file for the comparison. 
		<br>
		The audio file obtained through the WAV back to MIDI transcription can ba accessed <a href="After_the_Gold_Rush_Sonicvisualiser.mid">here</a>. 
		<br>The original WAV audio file can be accessed <a href="After_the_Gold_Rush.wav">here</a>.

			<h3> Comparison of the scores</h3> 
			
		<p>
			
		The automatic transcription from Midi/MuseScore to Audio/Wav and back to Midi/MuseScore resulted in a completely different notation comparing 
		to the file transcribed directly form the score. Its accuracy is also disputable. Just from examining the audio, it is clear the two files differ 
		significantly. The first difference is the lack of one of the three staves in the automatically transcribed file. It is the voice staff that
		disappeared during the automatic transcription. The lack of the voice part can be heard in the audio file. 
		<br>Additionally, meter changed from 4/4 to 3/4. This drastically changed the visual notation. The automatically transcribed file is much more 
		complex and has more additional signs around notes than the original. It makes the file very illegible. Just by looking at the two files' output, it is difficult to say they 
		notate the same sound. Furthermore, automatic transcription fastened the whole piece. It sounds much quicker. The tempo changed form moderato 
		(about 88-92 BPM) to a numerical value of 114. 
		The automatically transcribed file also lacks basic metadata visible in the original file.
