		<h3>Updating metadata </h3>
	
		<p>For this week's task I updated the MEI metadata with copyright statements. I decided to include Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) copyright. 
		This Creative Commons licence allows others to copy, distribute, modify and display under same terms as original for non-commercial purposes only. 
		Genre metadata was already included in last week's task. 
		<br><br>
		The updated metadata file can be accessed <a href="After_the_Gold_Rush_updated.mei">here.</a>
		
		<h3>Rendering updated metadata <h3>
