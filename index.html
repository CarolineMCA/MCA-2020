	<h1> MCA 2020 </h1>
	<h2> Task 1</h2>

		<h3>Dataset theme </h3>
	
		<p>The theme for my dataset for the project is based around a rock music from the 60’ and 70s. 
		These decades are considered the greatest time of rock music and the most iconic rock music of all times comes from these years.</p>
	
		<p>My project will focus on two of the most claimed artists of that time Neil Young and The Grateful Dead. 
		Their music represent similar genres, which allows to create a cohesive dataset.  
		They have written, composed and performed numerous songs and the vast catalogue of their work is perfectly suitable for 
		this project, as it let access a bigger number of music scores, acoustic recording and metadata.</p> 
				
		<p>Neil Young is a Canadian-American musician, singer and songwriter. He started his music career in the 1960s 
		and has been associated with broadly defined rock genre, blues, folk, country and psychedelic influences. 
		Since his beginnings in the music industry, he has been a successful musician. At the beginning he was performing 
		with the band Buffalo Springfield, to later create legendary band Crazy Horse and to collaborate with other musicians, 
		known as CSNY  band (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young). He is a successful and prolific solo musician as well.
		His latest new original material was an album Colorado (recorded and released in 2019) with Crazy Horse.</p>
				
		<p>The Grateful Dead, an American rock band, was formed in 1960s, and disband after 30 years on stage, in 1995, 
		after the death of the co-founder, Jerry Garcia. The band has reunited few times from 1995. Their unique style - 
		a mixture of rock, folk, jazz, blues, bluesgrass, country and gospel - became their trademark. Many of their live 
		performances gained ‘a legendary status’, popularised by fan-made bootleg tape recordings (with official recording 
		permission from the band). These bootlegs are for these days shared among fans, curated  and digitised by them and 
		make available online.</p>

	<h2> Task 2</h2>
			
		<h3>Data types availability and its current manifestation </h3>

		<h3> Music scores</h3>
		
		<p>Music scores to some of best-known songs by these artists are available online e.g. on Musescore. Other notation 
		websites also contain scores to their music, with some basic metadata, as title, artist and year of release. Most of 
		the music scores are unofficial, which means they were created and made available online by fans and other musicians.</p>
	
		<h3>Audio recordings</h3>
	
		<p>Audio recordings are available on most streaming services, such as Spotify or iTunes. Information about the albums and tracks, 
		such as time, year, label, and if applicable, editor’s notes can be found there. Live Music Archive provides live audio recordings
		of their songs, coming from e.g. fan-made cassette. There are also a waveform representations of these recordings on LMA.</p>
		
		<p>Similar to LMA, there is an unique fan-made website for The Grateful Dead bootlegs, ready to listen, which are accompanied by short 
		description and tracklist (time and place the recording was made). Additionally Youtube provides many official videos and audio recordings
		from the artists in this database, as well as unofficial live and fan-made recordings, which can be downloaded using external programmes.</p> 

		<h3>Metadata</h3>
	
		<p>The official sites of the artists provide much information about their releases, and are a good source of metadata. 
		Noteworthy, Neil Young website provides the most curated data. Each album is described in detail, with usual metadata, 
		such as song listing, time, release date, producers, alongside more advanced information about places the recordings took place, 
		catalogue number, all involved musicians and album art credentials. Similar, but less detailed is Dead’s website, with basic metadata
		about the albums, but more detailed information about the fans tape recordings. Both sites are constantly curating new material,
		as there is still a number of unreleased archival materials. The official stores also provide useful metadata of recordings, 
		but information there is very limited. </p>
